  "s_futureb_27": " *02* The orphanage seems to be a repurposed school, where the kids take care of each other. Nice enough place. Your imaginary friend, the blue hedgehog, was there too! But everybody steers clear from Susie, the one person who took immense interest in you. She drags you away from the others.",
  "s_futureb_28": " *03* Susie spouted strange things. You weren't paying attention half the time, inventing your own words for her to say. Something about protagonism, about being able to talk to the dead. She wished to show you more, so you follow her to a Haunted Point. Supposedly not the only one around.",
  "s_futureb_29": " *04* You were getting second and third thoughts, but it was too late. Susie tased you, using a tool that Alphys lost a while ago, and forces you inside the darkness. There's seemingly no escape. Not long after, something dragged you into the bottom. Things felt different since then.",
  "s_futureb_30": " *05* You woke up in the Land of the Dead, or at least that's one of its nicknames. With a brand new pair of glowing eyes, a scar that the Haunted Point left you with. They signal THE GIFT, the ability to talk to ghosts from your bloodline. You met your grandpa. You couldn't look at him face-on.",
  "s_futureb_31": " *06* Susie finds you, and kills you. You don't know why. You know even less why you came back from it. Alive, like it didn't happen. Are you invincible...? Susie said you were the protagonist, so that must mean she knew of your resurrectability. Right? That's a real word, right?",
  "s_futureb_32": " *07* An arrogant prince, Noyno, asks of much. He claims that the ghosts of YOU and Susie's mothers have united to conquer the land you're in, and your GIFT makes you the only one that can even come close to stopping them through physical means. It sounds impossible. YOU was too old to care.",
  "s_futureb_33": " *08* Before you could embark on your quest, a strong yet sensitive man named Lancer shows up, demanding the rights to YOU's time. He was shady, and that's saying something considering the rest of the people YOU's nearby. YOU and Susie swiftly chased him away. Susie left afterwards.",
  "s_futureb_34": " *09* That leaves YOU and Noyno to go and kill the MOTHERs. Noyno was harsh. Coercing. Had a dead body lying around, says it was his father's murderer. It's no longer anything more but a sandbag to train on. One could say Noyno was trying maybe a bit too hard to be mean. One could say that.",
  "s_futureb_35": " *10* Stepping out of the hideout, the Field was a desolate wasteland, the aftermath of the MOTHERSPAWN ghosts devouring and capturing most citizens that lived here. A placebo is nearby, a coping mechanism of YOU's imagination that gives them strength. This placebo was called the RealShield.",
  "s_futureb_36": " *11* Lancer was encountered in the Field Maze. Fearing for safety, YOU hummed a series of songs they heard when they were younger. For comfort. Speaking of the opposite, Susie was spotted and rejoined the party. Before, she had no interest in helping, now she does. What's with the inconsistency?",
  "s_futureb_37": " *12* The Time Philosopher was quite the head-in-the-clouds person themselves, and offered to sell a placebo to YOU, called the Time's Guard. All these ghosts were becoming too much. YOU imagined cuter ghosts, ones from an arcade game their dad used to play a ton. It made them feel better.",
  "s_futureb_38": " *13* Susie's strength was admirable, but her target choice was far from. Enemy or ally, her axe swung at whatever got close. Even Noyno thought it crossed a line. YOU stared at from afar, wondering what part of any of this was real. The dog thing, that probably wasn't.",
  "s_futureb_39": " *14* Lancer's ultimate reason for needing YOU was their ability to grant one wish to whoever desires it. Who wouldn't want that? Susie wouldn't. She defends YOU from Lancer, calling YOU their friend. YOU's eyes perk up. Friend? She's a friend? Noyno never said \"friend\". Only she ever said friend.",
  "s_futureb_40": " *15* Following a battle against Lancer's robotic contraption (according to what Noyno saw), Susie made another erratic decision by betraying YOU, and joining Lancer, a fellow robot-in-arms. YOU felt depressed. Noyno was baffled by this. Susie leaving was something to be happy about.",
  "s_futureb_41": " *16* The Forest was the designated hub for all MOTHERSPAWN ghosts, a great source of power for all of them. The name may imply one thing, but in truth, you know from what creation the MANOSPAWNS are really from. The Forest is a cheery place, have the ghosts made it that way?",
  "s_futureb_42": " *17* 2 PLACEBOS INCOMING. BE READY TO OBTAIN. YOU encountered a treasure chest within a Forest's dead end. Inside was Bug Friend. Even insects were exterminated in this land. You could only imagine how one looks like. Safe bets were, it looked like a friend.",
  "s_futureb_43": " *18* A red-hooded merchant was met, who was in the business of selling nocebos, negative-fueled thoughts of great risk. One of them is called ShameGrinder. The merchant made it clear they knew Noyno. But Noyno couldn't recognize them with the hood on. That's as far as the conversation went.",
  "s_futureb_44": " *19* In his spare time, Lancer built an AI designed to assist him in his hobbies, quiz-making being one of them. However, he was too self-absorbed and failed to notice the AI's own wishes. She ran out of power before Lancer could redeem himself. He'll live with it for the rest of his life.",
  "s_futureb_45": " *20* YOU decided to shut themselves off from the world, and entered one from a 90's RPG, their childhood game. Within, they've found the placebo Courage, something they've been missing for many, many years. Noyno waited hours, before YOU finally came back to reality, and so they pressed on.",
  "s_futureb_46": " *21* YOU and Noyno find a relative of the Time Philosopher, the smithee, who's spending their life fixing things up alongside two cat companions. Upon bringing an item, the smithee modifies it into time-shifting placebo Focus. YOU equips it, and completely forgets to use it. After all that work too...",
  "s_futureb_47": " *22* The latter half of the forest is enveloped in darkness, the mood turns, the MOTHER's homebase draws near. Noyno being nearby is not enough to calm YOU's nerves, so they pretended to have a dance-off against a silly-looking 3D animatronic. It took on the form of the Innkeeper. The person who abandoned them.",
  "s_futureb_48": " *23* Suddenly, Noyno's identity was put into question by Lancer and Susie, using his hidden journal. It turns out, he's no prince. He's no royalty. That dead body he kept, he wasn't the one who killed it. Noyno's personality broke apart. He had no way to defend himself. His entire being was just invalidated.",
  "s_futureb_49": " *24* At that moment, YOU really put it into perspective just how broken these people were. Noyno lied, but why? Susie killed, but for what? Lancer wants a wish, but what kind? Everyone has a motive, but they refuse to share it. It was so frustrating. How could YOU possibly bring themselves to trust anyone?",
  "s_futureb_50": " *25* In the past, Noyno tried summoning other heroes to assist him in defeating the MOTHERs. He tried his best. He made a picnic, he put his full support behind them... but the heroes were cruel, and rejected his plea. Noyno didn't look or sound like a leader, or even like he'd be helpful. Noyno... couldn't understand.",
  "s_futureb_51": " *26* Later, Noyno found a dead body with a nearby rope attached to a cliff. Likely a climbing accident. Noyno thought of giving it a proper burial, but the mocking words of the heroes rang in his head. Could he... use this somehow, to make himself look more threatening? Someone you can't say no to?",
  "s_futureb_52": " *27* Noyno discarded his morality, and assumed the role of a sociopathic strict leader. But truthfully, he hated being that way, for it was not what bolstered his courage. It was his desire to recreate the world from his childhood that drove him forward. Upon receiving Noelle's forgiveness, Noyno realized... maybe it's not too late to push such ideology.",
  "s_futureb_53": " *28* Thus, when YOU and Noyno met Lancer and Susie the next time, Noyno shed every vile part of himself, and strengthened his DETERMINATION in the name of avenging everyone who was lost to the MOTHERs. He popped the champagne in the form of kicking Lancer's ass. Both their egos were cut in half, that day.",
  "s_futureb_54": " *29* With Lancer gaining respect for Noyno's ways, he and Susie tagged along to fight the MOTHERs together. Bonding ensued. Susie mentioned how she became a robot seven months ago, with Mary's support. Her sister. She wasn't making much sense, but that was par for the course.",
  "s_futureb_55": " *30* Just when things were looking up, the entire gang was captured and imprisoned within the Lodge's basement. The silver lining being that they were now in the MOTHERs' homebase at least. Susie, suspiciously so, was the only one who got out of her cell, and was faced with the decision to free Noyno and YOU. ",
  "s_futureb_56": " *31* The ghost of Mary, Susie's sister, offered a different solution. Kill everyone now, so they won't do something stupid later. Susie found it hard to go against her word. Not only mentally, but physically. It brings to question just how much of Susie's actions she has self-control over. If any at all.",
  "s_futureb_57": " *32* Susie stumbles into Lancer, and lies about YOU and Noyno's whereabouts. Lancer brings up Dr. Alphys during the conversation, a scientist who created Lancer's robotic body. Susie knows Alphys. And hearing her name, brought back memories of the day Alphys made her lose all ability to feel. When she was converted into a robot.",
  "s_futureb_58": " *33* With Mary standing right behind her, and Susie remembering that awful day, she lost control of herself, and rather than killing YOU and Noyno, she took out her killing desire on Lancer. But he wasn't going down without a few tricks up his sleeve. Despite Alphys' warnings, he assumed his superform, and became Metta.",
  "s_futureb_59": " *34* Meanwhile, YOU and Noyno were unaware of what was happening outside their cell, but YOU suspected something was wrong. They were validated in this thinking by finding a placebo on the wall, named BadFeeling. But was it really a placebo? It seemed reminscent of the opposite... oh well, it was useless anyway.",
  "s_futureb_60": " *35* Metta VS. Susie. Metta's wish extended far beyond what he said earlier. He didn't just want to revive Maddy - his AI companion - or the robot race. He would use YOU to revive all of monsterkind and gain fame and recognition as their saviour. That way, he'd achieve his goal of The Ultimate Entertainment Robot, with a billion-wide range audience.",
  "s_futureb_61": " *36* Susie was engulfed by nihilism. Her life already as broken as it was, Metta's words only stung more. She said to give up, but it's hard to say if those words were aimed at Lancer. Her axe was enough to destroy his overclocked body. His last thoughts were of Maddy. He was flawed, but deserved better.",
  "s_futureb_62": "                                                 *37* The mood changed.                                                                ",
  "s_futureb_63": " *38* YOU, Susie, and Noyno rode the elevator out of the prison, without a word spoken. Susie was feeling nauseous. Once again, she was forced to kill. THE GIFT controlled every facet of her, but for one brief moment, she managed to overpower it, and told YOU to end her life. To her, there seemed no other way to break free.",
  "s_futureb_64": " *39* But YOU had problems emerging of their own. Their frog relatives became more hostile, the surrounding enviroment became scarier. The jokes they could imagine before, were getting more difficult to visualize. YOU became increasingly more willing to kill. The gift turned Susie into this. Now, it'll do the same to YOU.",
  "s_futureb_65": " *40* Amidst tensions, the trio met a shapeshifting entity tasked with maintaining balance of worlds all over. EveryName is the maintainer's nametainer. They looked at the complete mess that was your world, and opted to play with your patience. After a long struggle, they were generous enough to give you the placebo, EveryName.",
  "s_futureb_66": " *41* The trio entered the Lodge, taller than on the outside, a world where you felt like a stowaway within a ship that was doing perfectly fine without you. It is the home of MOTHERSPAWNs, who are destined to extract veins from their deceased prey, in the name of appeasing the MOTHERs. But... would your MOTHERs really do something like this?",
  "s_futureb_67": " *42* Susie and YOU's mental state was growing worse, leaving only Noyno to try to keep them together. The Lodge was where The Gift originated. It's here where its side-effects are strongest. Susie tried her hardest to slow down your advance. YOU could only think about killing Susie. But a part of them... felt something even more disturbing. Friendship.",
  "s_futureb_68": " *43* A wedding ceremony took place on the Lodge's 2nd floor, and one of the trio had no choice but to marry the wedding dress, just sitting there. In return, they got the placebo, WeddingRing. Upon closer inspection, the wedding dress seemed more like a... nightgown? It used to be worn by the victims.",
  "s_futureb_69": " *44* 6th floor in, a blue gate blocked the trio's way. So close, yet so far... but then, Susie touched the gate, and it recognized her as the vessel. The vessel for the one who rules over this Lodge. The MOTHERs? No. That's plural. So, there's somebody else then...? In any case, they were allowed entry inside.",
  "s_futureb_70": " *45* It all came to a boil when they found a survivor with a broken leg, which YOU suddenly attacked. But thankfully, Noyno helped them run away. He couldn't stand it anymore. He couldn't trust YOU and Susie. He didn't know what the gift was doing to them, but it didn't make a difference. He felt he stood a better chance by himself, so left he did.",
  "s_futureb_71": " *46* YOU and Susie went further in, and found someone's personal room. Stray alcohol bottles, closet full of chalk. A diary. A photo of Susie and a human friend. Susie had her own room in the Lodge. And she's been spending a lot of time here. Susie was right there, but didn't say a word. She simply let YOU absorb all this information in.",
  "s_futureb_72": " *47* Looking out the balcony, Susie posed a simple question to YOU. What do you think of her? Any normal person would immediately roll out a giant scroll of complaints. But YOU, seemed like they genuinely cared for her. Susie was taken aback. That... is not what she expected to hear. In fact. That is not what she wanted to hear.",
  "s_futureb_73": " *48* Ultimately, Susie provoked YOU throughout the adventure, threatening and conflicting their feelings, because 1) The Gift would only purely allow her to be violent, and 2) If YOU hates her enough, they'll kill her. They're the only one strong enough to do it. And thus, Susie will be free of The Gift, and the agonizing torture it put her through.",
  "s_futureb_74": " *49* But Susie made a mistake, calling YOU her friend back in the Field. YOU spent nearly their whole life without friends, and was a few months away from dying of old age. Even though The Gift was pressuring YOU into killing Susie, a part of them couldn't do it. YOU was stuck in a twisted mentality, and would not let go of the one friend they got.",
  "s_futureb_75": " *50* They wouldn't have time to ponder these horrifying feelings. The MOTHERs' final phase has begun. They called on the power of shooting stars, and bombarded the whole world to wipe out the rest of the living stragglers. The Lodge was the only safe place now. And even that could be called anything but.",
  "s_futureb_76": " *51* YOU and Susie met face to face with the culprits, their MOTHERs. But Susie couldn't care less. Her plan to be wiped out by YOU failed. On behalf of YOU, she tried to create an impossible situation that would force YOU to reset all the way back to the start. Suddenly, a Noyno fueled by irritation intervened, starting his own battle.",
  "s_futureb_77": " *52* It was then that the MOTHERs vanished, for they were mere mirages projected by the true evil controlling them by strings. MANOS appears, the creator of MANOSPAWNs, the sacrificer of countless orphanaged children who Susie unwillfully brought to it. The most hollow and disgusting form of evil that has ever half-existed.",
  "s_futureb_78": " *53* The battle against MANOS was all but smooth, with Noyno, the party's one hope, becoming a casualty first. YOU's soul was then almost swallowed into the realm within MANOS, but Susie dove in and rescued them, trading places in return. Now, YOU was the only living being left, and with Susie gone, they chose to fight with all their might.",
  "s_futureb_79": " *54* Taking advantage of the shooting stars that were destroying the world, YOU recalled a time back when life felt normal, watching TV and playing games with their family. In the form of wishes, these memories came out as real power, to return things to the way they used to be. YOU's imagination was no longer only within their head.",
  "s_futureb_80": " *55* MANOS was obliterated via the Final Wish, and the world was reshaped to one in which Noyno lives as a true king. There were limits to how powerful this wish was, but YOU believed Noyno would take care of the rest. YOU and Susie awaken next to Noyno, and everything felt... right, for one brief moment.",
  "s_futureb_81": " *56* But even with MANOS gone, the effects of The Gift lingered. YOU and Susie knew they would pose a significant threat to others if they remained here. After trying to explain to Noyno what The Gift really is, Noyno understood they had no control over their actions. And it was all the more depressing that he couldn't help them in any way.",
  "s_futureb_82": " *57* After a final farewell, YOU and Susie left content, knowing that Noyno will rebuild things back to normal. They sealed themselves within the nearby chamber, and engaged in a final battle. One would die by the other's hand, and the other would remain trapped within this room forever. This battle would decide who gets the worst fate.",
  "s_futureb_83": " *58* As for who won? You won't know, because I don't either. The future is always one step ahead of us, and no one can predict its outcome. Things might've ended up okay, or maybe not. The more you'll worry about it, the more you'll forget that in the present, they're still fighting it out. To believe in the implication of death, makes me wonder one thing.",
  "s_futureb_84": " *59* Why were we cursed to favor negativity far more strongly than that which makes us happy?",
  "s_futureb_85": " *60* The recap is about to loop. How many placebos have you touched so far? There are 9 in total. Use your ACTs, and think of approximate placebo locations within the recap's chronological order. Now, here we go again...",
